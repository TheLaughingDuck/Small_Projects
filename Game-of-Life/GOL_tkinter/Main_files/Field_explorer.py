Everything related to exploring the field.

Will be able to backtrack(sort of) and find chains and cycles etc. In my
dreams at least.

Works, sort of, has found about 13 parents to the ring. Most of them not very
interesting, but a few are!

Next step;

1) search for ring-parents again, but with a 2-level garden!

2) Search for parents to the ring-parents!
